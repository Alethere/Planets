Another change
Two moons orbit Mars: Phobos the moon of Fear, and Deimos the moon Pain. Their size
is too small to spherize and they are still just asteroids. They are sad, they do not
shine with the sun. 
Why have you forsaken the Red dust of war? Why, Sun, you burn these parched rocks
as if they had disappointed your flaming soul?
